## 1. STM32WB Series
 **A dual-core, multi-protocol and ultra‐low‐power 2.4 GHz MCU Series** -
 https://goo.gl/hfoZHW


The new STM32WB wireless System-on-Chip (SoC) devices combine a fully-featured
Arm Cortex M4-based microcontroller to run the main application as well as an
Arm Cortex-M0+ core to offload the main processor and offer real time operation
on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5 and IEEE 802.15.4 radio. The radio can also
run other wireless protocols concurrently, including OpenThread, ZigBee,
or proprietary protocols, giving even more options for connecting devices to
the Internet of Things (IoT).

**Main Features**

 - Dual Processor:
  - fully-featured Arm Cortex-M4-based microcontroller to run the main
application
   - Arm Cortex-M0+ core to offload the main processor and offer real time
operation on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5 and IEEE 802.15.4 radio

- Supports OpenThread, **ZigBee** and other proprietary protocols
